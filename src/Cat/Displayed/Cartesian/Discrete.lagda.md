# Discrete cartesian fibrations

A **discrete cartesian fibration** or **discrete fibration** is a
[[displayed category]] whose [[fibre categories]] are all _discrete categories_:
thin, univalent groupoids. Since thin, univalent groupoids are sets, a
discrete fibration over $\cB$ is an alternate way of encoding a presheaf
over $\cB$, i.e., a functor $\cB\op\to\Sets$. Here, we identify a purely fibrational
property that picks out the discrete fibrations among the displayed
categories, without talking about the fibres directly.

:::{.definition #discrete-cartesian-fibration alias="discrete-fibration"}
A discrete cartesian fibration is a displayed category such that each type of
displayed objects is a set, and such that, for each right corner

~~~

there is a contractible space of objects $x'$ over $x$ equipped with
maps $x' \to_f y'$.

We will denote the canonical lift of $f$ to $y'$ as
$$
\pi_{f, y'}^{*} : f^{*}(y') \to_{f} y'
$$

```agda
    _^*_ : ∀ {x y} → (f : B.Hom x y) (y' : E.Ob[ y ]) → E.Ob[ x ]
    f ^* y' = cart-lift f y' .centre .fst

    π* : ∀ {x y} → (f : B.Hom x y) (y' : E.Ob[ y ]) → E.Hom[ f ] (f ^* y') y'
    π* f y' = cart-lift f y' .centre .snd
```

## Basic properties of discrete cartesian fibrations

Every hom set of a discrete fibration is a [[proposition]].

```agda
    Hom[]-is-prop : ∀ {x y x' y'} {f : B.Hom x y} → is-prop (Hom[ f ] x' y')
```

Let $f', f'' : x' \to_{f} y'$ be a pair of morphisms in $\cE$. Both
$(x', f')$ and $(x' , f'')$ are candidates for lifts of $y'$ along
$f$, so contractibility of lifts ensures that $(x', f') = (x' , f'')$.
Moreover, the type of objects in $\cE$ forms a [[set]], so we can
conclude that $f' = f''$.

```agda
    Hom[]-is-prop {x' = x'} {y' = y'} {f = f} f' f'' =
      Σ-inj-set (fibre-set _) $
      is-contr→is-prop (cart-lift f y') (x' , f') (x' , f'')
```

We can improve the previous result by noticing that morphisms
$f' : x' \to_{f} y'$ give rise to proofs that $f^*(y') = x'$.

```agda
    opaque
      ^*-lift
        : ∀ {x y x' y'}
        → (f : B.Hom x y)
        → Hom[ f ] x' y'
        → f ^* y' ≡ x'
      ^*-lift {x' = x'} {y' = y'} f f' =
        ap fst $ cart-lift f y' .paths (x' , f')
```

We can further improve this to an equivalence between paths
$f^{*}(y') = x'$ and morphisms $x' \to y'$.

```agda
      ^*-hom
        : ∀ {x y x' y'}
        → (f : B.Hom x y)
        → f ^* y' ≡ x'
        → Hom[ f ] x' y'
      ^*-hom {x' = x'} {y' = y'} f p =
        hom[ B.idr f ] $
          π* f y' ∘' subst (λ y' → Hom[ B.id ] x' y') (sym p) id'

      ^*-hom-is-equiv
        : ∀ {x y x' y'}
        → (f : B.Hom x y)
        → is-equiv (^*-hom {x' = x'} {y' = y'} f)
      ^*-hom-is-equiv f =
        is-iso→is-equiv $
        iso (^*-lift f)
          (λ _ → Hom[]-is-prop _ _)
          (λ _ → fibre-set _ _ _ _ _)
```

## Functoriality of lifts

The (necessarily unique) choice of lifts in a discrete fibration are
contravariantly functorial.

```agda
    ^*-id
      : ∀ {x} (x' : Ob[ x ])
      → B.id ^* x' ≡ x'

    ^*-∘
      : ∀ {x y z}
      → (f : B.Hom y z) (g : B.Hom x y) (z' : Ob[ z ])
      → (f B.∘ g) ^* z' ≡ g ^* (f ^* z')
```

The proof here is rather slick. As noted earlier morphisms $x' \to_{f} y'$
in a discrete fibration correspond to proofs that $f^{*}(y') = x'$, so
it suffices to construct morphisms $x' \to_{id} x'$ and
$g^{*}(f^{*}(z')) \to_{f \circ g} z'$, resp. The former is given by
the identity morphism, and the latter by composition of lifts!

```agda
    ^*-id x' = ^*-lift B.id id'
    ^*-∘ f g z' = ^*-lift (f B.∘ g) (π* f z' ∘' π* g (f ^* z'))
```

## Invertible maps in discrete cartesian fibrations

Let $f : x \to y$ be an [[invertible]] morphism of $\cB$. If $\cE$
is a discrete fibration, then every morphism displayed over $f$ is
also invertible.

```agda
    all-invertible[]
      : ∀ {x y x' y'} {f : B.Hom x y}
      → (f' : Hom[ f ] x' y')
      → (f⁻¹ : B.is-invertible f)
      → is-invertible[ f⁻¹ ] f'
```

Let $f : x \to y$ be an invertible morphism, and $f' : x' \to_{f} y'$
be a morphism lying over $f$. Every hom set of $\cE$ is a proposition,
so constructing an inverse only requires us to exhibit a map
$y' \to_{f^{-1}} x'$, which in turn is given by a proof that $(f^{-1})^{*}(x') = y'$.
This is easy enough to prove with a bit of algebra.

```agda
    all-invertible[] {x' = x'} {y' = y'} {f = f} f' f⁻¹ = f'⁻¹ where
      module f⁻¹ = B.is-invertible f⁻¹
      open is-invertible[_]

      f'⁻¹ : is-invertible[ f⁻¹ ] f'
      f'⁻¹ .inv' =
        ^*-hom f⁻¹.inv $
          f⁻¹.inv ^* x'         ≡˘⟨ ap (f⁻¹.inv ^*_) (^*-lift f f') ⟩
          f⁻¹.inv ^* (f ^* y')  ≡˘⟨ ^*-∘ f f⁻¹.inv y' ⟩
          (f B.∘ f⁻¹.inv) ^* y' ≡⟨ ap (_^* y') f⁻¹.invl ⟩
          B.id ^* y'            ≡⟨ ^*-id y' ⟩
          y'                    ∎
      f'⁻¹ .inverses' .Inverses[_].invl' =
        is-prop→pathp (λ _ → Hom[]-is-prop) _ _
      f'⁻¹ .inverses' .Inverses[_].invr' =
        is-prop→pathp (λ _ → Hom[]-is-prop) _ _
```

As an easy corollary, we get that all vertical maps in a discrete
fibration are invertible.

```agda
    all-invertible↓
      : ∀ {x x' y'}
      → (f' : Hom[ B.id {x} ] x' y')
      → is-invertible↓ f'
    all-invertible↓ f' = all-invertible[] f' B.id-invertible
```


## Cartesian maps in discrete fibrations

Every morphism in a discrete fibration is [[cartesian|cartesian-morphism]].
Every hom set in a discrete fibration is propositional, so we just
need to establish the existence portion of the universal property.

```agda
    all-cartesian
      : ∀ {x y x' y'} {f : B.Hom x y}
      → (f' : Hom[ f ] x' y')
      → is-cartesian E f f'
    all-cartesian f' .commutes _ _ = Hom[]-is-prop _ _
    all-cartesian f' .unique _ _ = Hom[]-is-prop _ _
```

Suppose we have an open diagram

~~~{.quiver}
\[\begin{tikzcd}
  {u'} \\
  & {x'} && {y'} \\
  u \\
  & x && {y,}
  \arrow["{f'}"', from=2-2, to=2-4]
  \arrow["f", from=4-2, to=4-4]
  \arrow[lies over, from=2-2, to=4-2]
  \arrow[lies over, from=2-4, to=4-4]
  \arrow["g"', from=3-1, to=4-2]
  \arrow[lies over, from=1-1, to=3-1]
  \arrow["{h'}", curve={height=-12pt}, from=1-1, to=2-4]
\end{tikzcd}\]
~~~

where $f' : x' \to_{f} y'$ is the unique lift of $f$ along $y'$. We need to
find a map $u' \to_{g} x'$. By the usual yoga, it suffices to show that
$g^{*}(x') = u'$.

Note that we can transform $f' : x' \to_{f} y'$ into a proof that $f^{*}(y') = x'$,
and $h'$ into a proof that $(f \circ g)^{*}(y') = u'$. Moreover,
$(f \circ g)^{*}(y') = g^{*}(f^{*}(y'))$. Putting this all together, we get:

$$
\begin{align*}
g^{*}(x') &= g^{*}(f^{*}(y')) \\
          &= (f \circ g)^{*}(y') \\
          &= u'
\end{align*}
$$

```agda
    all-cartesian {x' = x'} {y' = y'} {f = f} f' .universal {u' = u'} g h' =
      ^*-hom g $
        g ^* x'          ≡˘⟨ ap (g ^*_) (^*-lift f f') ⟩
        (g ^* (f ^* y')) ≡˘⟨ ^*-∘ f g y' ⟩
        (f B.∘ g) ^* y'  ≡⟨ ^*-lift (f B.∘ g) h' ⟩
        u'               ∎
```

## Discrete fibrations are cartesian

To prove that discrete fibrations deserve the name discrete
_fibrations_, we prove that any discrete fibration is a [[Cartesian
fibration]].

```agda
  discrete→cartesian : is-discrete-cartesian-fibration → Cartesian-fibration E
  discrete→cartesian disc = r where
    open is-discrete-cartesian-fibration disc
    r : Cartesian-fibration E
```

Luckily for us, the sea has already risen to meet us: by assumption,
every right corner has a unique lift, and every morphism in a discrete
fibration is cartesian.

```agda
    r .has-lift f y' .x' = f ^* y'
    r .has-lift f y' .lifting = π* f y'
    r .has-lift f y' .cartesian = all-cartesian (π* f y')
```

## Discrete fibrations are presheaves

As noted earlier, a discrete fibration over $\cB$ encodes the same
data as a presheaf on $\cB$. First, let us show that we can construct
a presheaf from a discrete fibration.

<!--
```agda
module _ {o ℓ} (B : Precategory o ℓ)  where
  private
    module B = Precategory B
```
-->

```agda
  discrete→presheaf
    : ∀ {o' ℓ'} (E : Displayed B o' ℓ')
    → is-discrete-cartesian-fibration E
    → Functor (B ^op) (Sets o')
  discrete→presheaf {o' = o'} E disc = psh where
    module E = Displayed E
    open is-discrete-cartesian-fibration disc
```

For each object in $X : \cB$, we take the set of objects $E$ that
lie over $X$. The functorial action of `f : Hom X Y` is then constructed
by taking the domain of the lift of `f`. Functoriality follows by
uniqueness of the lifts.

```agda
    psh : Functor (B ^op) (Sets o')
    psh .Functor.F₀ X = el E.Ob[ X ] (fibre-set X)
    psh .Functor.F₁ f X' = f ^* X'
    psh .Functor.F-id = funext λ X' → ^*-id X'
    psh .Functor.F-∘ {X} {Y} {Z} f g = funext λ X' → ^*-∘ g f X'
```

To construct a discrete fibration from a presheaf $P$, we take the
[(displayed) category of elements] of $P$. This is a natural choice,
as it encodes the same data as $P$, just rendered down into a soup
of points and bits of functions. Discreteness follows immediately
from the contractibilty of singletons.

[(displayed) category of elements]: Cat.Displayed.Instances.Elements.html

```agda
  presheaf→discrete
    : ∀ {κ} → Functor (B ^op) (Sets κ)
    → Σ[ E ∈ Displayed B κ κ ] is-discrete-cartesian-fibration E
  presheaf→discrete {κ = κ} P = ∫ B P , discrete where
    module P = Functor P

    discrete : is-discrete-cartesian-fibration (∫ B P)
    discrete .is-discrete-cartesian-fibration.fibre-set X =
      P.₀ X .is-tr
    discrete .is-discrete-cartesian-fibration.cart-lift f P[Y] =
      contr (P.₁ f P[Y] , refl) Singleton-is-contr
```

We conclude by proving that the two maps defined above are, in fact,
inverses. Most of the complexity is in [characterising paths between
displayed categories][disppath], but that doesn't mean that the proof
here is entirely trivial, either. Well, first, we note that one
direction _is_ trivial: modulo differences in the proofs of
functoriality, which do not matter for identity, turning a functor into
a discrete fibration and back is the identity.

[disppath]: Cat.Displayed.Path.html

```agda
  open is-iso

  presheaf≃discrete : ∀ {κ} → is-iso (presheaf→discrete {κ = κ})
  presheaf≃discrete .inv  (d , f) = discrete→presheaf d f
  presheaf≃discrete .linv x       = Functor-path (λ _ → n-path refl) λ _ → refl
```

The other direction is where the complication lies. Given a discrete
fibration $P \liesover X$, how do we show that $\int P \equiv P$? Well,
by the aforementioned characterisation of paths in displayed categories,
it'll suffice to construct a functor $(\int P) \to P$ (lying over the
identity), then show that this functor has an invertible action on
objects, and an invertible action on morphisms.

```agda
  presheaf≃discrete .rinv (P , p-disc) = Σ-prop-path hl ∫≡dx where
    open is-discrete-cartesian-fibration p-disc
    open Displayed-functor
    open Displayed P
```

The functor will send an object $c \liesover x$ to that same object $c$;
This is readily seen to be invertible. But the action on morphisms is
slightly more complicated. Recall that, since $P$ is a discrete
fibration, every span $b' \liesover b \xot{f} a$ has a contractible
space of Cartesian lifts $(a', f')$. Our functor must, given objects
$a'', b'$, a map $f : a \to b$, and a proof that $a'' = a'$, produce a
map $a'' \to_f b$ --- so we can take the canonical $f' : a' \to_f b$ and
transport it over the given $a'' = a'$.

```agda
    pieces : Displayed-functor (∫ B (discrete→presheaf P p-disc)) P Id
    pieces .F₀' x = x
    pieces .F₁' {f = f} {a'} {b'} x =
      subst (λ e → Hom[ f ] e b') x $ cart-lift f b' .centre .snd
```

This transport _threatens_ to throw a spanner in the works, since it is
an equation between objects (over $a$). But since $P$ is a discrete
fibration, the space of objects over $a$ is a set, so this equation
_can't_ ruin our day. Directly from the uniqueness of $(a', f')$ we
conclude that we've put together a functor.

```agda
    pieces .F-id' =
      is-prop→pathp (λ _ → Hom[]-is-prop) _ _
    pieces .F-∘' {f = f} {g} {a'} {b'} {c'} {f'} {g'} =
      is-prop→pathp (λ _ → Hom[]-is-prop) _ _
```

It remains to show that, given a map $a'' \to b$ (and the rest of the
data $a$, $b$, $f : a \to b$, $b' \liesover b$), we can recover a proof
that $a''$ is the chosen lift $a'$. But again, lifts are unique, so this
is immediate.

```agda
    ∫≡dx : ∫ B (discrete→presheaf P p-disc) ≡ P
    ∫≡dx = Displayed-path pieces (λ _ → id-equiv) (is-iso→is-equiv p) where
      p : ∀ {a b} {f : B.Hom a b} {a'} {b'} → is-iso (pieces .F₁' {f = f} {a'} {b'})
      p .inv f  = ap fst $ cart-lift _ _ .paths (_ , f)
      p .rinv p = from-pathp (ap snd (cart-lift _ _ .paths _))
      p .linv p = fibre-set _ _ _ _ _
```

We must additionally show that the witness that $P$ is a discrete
fibration will survive a round-trip through the type of presheaves, but
this witness lives in a proposition (it is a pair of propositions), so
it survives automatically.

```agda
    private unquoteDecl eqv = declare-record-iso eqv (quote is-discrete-cartesian-fibration)
    hl : ∀ x → is-prop _
    hl x = Iso→is-hlevel! 1 eqv
```
